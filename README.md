# CMD
A simple python command interpreter made in Python 3.
# Install Modules
CMD requires a couple modules to run:  
```pip install time```  
```pip install termcolor```  
```pip install cmd```  
# Making your CMD account
When you run CMD, you are asked to enter your username. By default, there is one account named `root`. Login to this account with the password `12tte21k`. Once logged in, type `new [username]`. This will make a user called `[username]`. Then, type `restart` and login to your new account.  
# Using CMD
Once logged in to your account (see [Making your CMD account](#-making-your-cmd-account)), you have access to almost all CMD commands. To start, type `help`. You will see all of the commands available.
